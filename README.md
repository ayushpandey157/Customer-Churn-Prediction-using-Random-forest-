# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Random-forest-
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning techniques on the popular Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service based on historical data such as demographics, service subscriptions, and payment information. The project involves data preprocessing, feature encoding, model building with Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The solution can help businesses proactively retain customers by targeting high-risk users. The models were implemented in Python using Scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries.
